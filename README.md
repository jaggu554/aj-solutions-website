# AJ Solutions Private Limited — Static Website

This repository contains a simple, production-ready static website for AJ Solutions Private Limited (HTML5, CSS3, optional minimal JS). It's Netlify-ready and fully responsive.

Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
2. Initialize git, commit and push (if not already):

```bash
git init
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AJ Solutions static website"
```

Deploy to Netlify
- Option A: Drag & drop the project folder in the Netlify dashboard.
- Option B: Connect a GitHub repo and let Netlify auto-deploy on push.

Notes
- No backend required. The contact form uses `mailto:`.
- Images placeholder located in the `images/` folder.

If you want, I can create a GitHub repo and push the project for you (requires `gh` CLI or manual authorization).
